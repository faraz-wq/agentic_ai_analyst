# Explanation of New Code Implementation

## Overview

In this commit I have implemented the ingestion agent, shifting from the initial prototype CLI tool to a multi-agent system for data analytics. The new implementation follows a modular, agent-based approach that separates concerns and enables more sophisticated data analysis workflows.

## Architecture Changes

### From Monolithic to Multi-Agent Architecture

The previous implementation (`main.py`) was a monolithic CLI application that performed all data analytics steps sequentially within a single class. The new architecture decomposes this functionality into specialized agents that can work independently and collaboratively.

### Core Components

The new code is organized into several key modules:

1. **Core Module** - Contains shared components:
   - `state.py`: Defines the shared state object that flows between agents
   - `tools.py`: Implements LangChain tools for agent execution

2. **Agents Module** - Contains specialized agents:
   - `ingestion_agent.py`: Implements the data ingestion and profiling agent

3. **Orchestrator** - Coordinates agent execution:
   - `orchestrator.py`: Example orchestration logic

## Detailed Component Analysis

### 1. Shared State Management (`core/state.py`)

The `AgentState` class is a Pydantic model that serves as the central data structure for communication between agents. It maintains:

- **Input parameters**: File paths and output directories
- **Data storage**: Raw DataFrame and data profile information
- **Workflow tracking**: Logs and error states
- **Agent status**: Completion flags for each processing stage

This design enables agents to work independently while maintaining a consistent view of the overall workflow state.

### 2. LangChain Tools (`core/tools.py`)

Four specialized tools have been implemented for the ingestion agent:

- **`read_dataframe`**: Loads data from various formats (CSV, Excel, JSON) with automatic encoding detection
- **`standardize_dataframe`**: Converts column names to snake_case and deduplicates columns
- **`generate_profile`**: Creates comprehensive data profiles using ydata-profiling
- **`save_standardized_data`**: Saves processed data to CSV format

These tools are decorated with LangChain's `@tool` decorator, making them compatible with LangChain agents.

### 3. Ingestion Agent (`agents/ingestion_agent.py`)

The ingestion agent is implemented with two main functions:

- **`create_ingestion_agent`**: Configures a LangChain agent with:
  - A specialized LLM (Qwen3 Coder via OpenRouter)
  - The four ingestion tools
  - A detailed system prompt that defines the agent's responsibilities and workflow
  
- **`run_ingestion_agent`**: Executes the agent workflow:
  - Validates inputs
  - Creates and invokes the agent
  - Updates the shared state with results
  - Handles errors gracefully

The agent follows a strict workflow sequence:

1. Load data from file
2. Standardize dataset
3. Generate profile report
4. Save standardized data

### 4. Orchestration (`orchestrator.py`)

The orchestrator demonstrates how to use the ingestion agent:

- Creates initial state with input file and output directory
- Executes the ingestion agent
- Processes results and handles errors
- Displays logs and key metrics

## Key Improvements Over Previous Implementation

1. **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns between different processing stages
2. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new agents for additional functionality
3. **AI Integration**: Uses LangChain agents with LLMs for intelligent decision-making
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging
5. **Standardized Communication**: Shared state object ensures consistent data flow
6. **Tool-Based Approach**: Reusable tools that can be composed in different ways

## Future Development

This architecture provides a solid foundation for implementing additional agents:

- Data Cleaning & Transformation Agent
- Insights & Analysis Agent
- Documentation & Logging Agent

Each agent can be developed independently while leveraging the shared state and tool infrastructure.
