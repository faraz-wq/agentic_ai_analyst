# Commit Note: Implementation of Insights & Analysis Agent and Supporting Enhancements

This commit introduces a new **Insights & Analysis Agent** to the data processing pipeline, extending the workflow to include advanced statistical analysis, visualization generation, and policy-oriented insights extraction. It builds upon the existing ingestion and cleaning agents by adding a third stage that analyzes cleaned data to produce actionable insights for policymakers. Additionally, it enhances the core state management, expands the toolset with analysis-specific functions, and updates the orchestrator to integrate the new agent. Below is a detailed breakdown of the changes, organized by file and purpose.

---

## 1. `agents/insights_agent.py`

**Changes:**

- **New File Creation**: Added `insights_agent.py` to implement the **Insights & Analysis Agent**, designed to extract statistically significant patterns and generate policy-relevant recommendations.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Agent Creation (`create_insights_agent`)**:
    - Configures a `ChatOpenAI` model using the Cerebras API with the `qwen-3-235b-a22b-instruct-2507` model, a low temperature (0.1) for deterministic outputs, and a high token limit (2000).
    - Returns a raw LLM instance for custom agent logic, avoiding issues with `response_format` and `agent_scratchpad`.
  - **Agent Execution (`run_insights_agent`)**:
    - Takes an `AgentState` object with cleaned data as input, ensuring prerequisites (e.g., cleaned data availability) are met.
    - Creates a `visualizations` subdirectory in the output directory for storing generated plots.
    - Serializes the cleaned DataFrame to JSON, handling datetime columns by converting them to strings for compatibility.
    - Defines a comprehensive system prompt that instructs the agent to:
      1. Explore data systematically using provided tools.
      2. Identify significant patterns (e.g., trends, correlations, equity concerns).
      3. Validate findings with statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square).
      4. Generate visualizations for clear communication.
      5. Formulate actionable policy recommendations.
    - Implements a custom agent loop (up to 10 iterations) to:
      - Parse tool calls using regex (`[tool_name]({args})`) and execute tools like `perform_eda_summary`, `analyze_correlations`, `identify_trends`, `detect_imbalances`, `run_statistical_tests`, `create_visualization`, and `generate_insights_summary`.
      - Handle errors gracefully, logging issues and continuing the loop.
      - Store intermediate results (analysis results, visualization paths) and append tool outputs to the message history.
      - Expect a final JSON output with `insights`, `analysis_report`, and `visualizations_generated`.
    - Saves the statistical analysis results as `statistical_analysis.json` and generates a Markdown policy insights report (`policy_insights_report.md`) using the `generate_policy_report` function.
    - Updates the `AgentState` with insights, analysis report, visualizations, and logs.
    - Returns a dictionary indicating completion status or errors.
  - **Policy Report Generation (`generate_policy_report`)**:
    - Creates a Markdown report with sections for:
      - **Executive Summary**: Summarizes up to 5 key insights.
      - **Key Insights**: Details each insight with title, description, evidence, implications, and recommendations.
      - **Data Gaps**: Notes any gaps from the cleaning report.
      - **Recommendations**: Aggregates unique recommendations across insights.
    - Ensures clear, policy-oriented formatting for stakeholder communication.

**Purpose:**

- Introduces a sophisticated analysis layer to the pipeline, enabling the extraction of actionable insights from cleaned data.
- Supports policy decision-making by identifying trends, correlations, imbalances, and statistical significance, validated through rigorous testing.
- Enhances communication through visualizations and structured reports, making findings accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

## 2. `core/state.py`

**Changes:**

- **New Fields Added**:
  - `insights`: Stores a list of insight dictionaries (title, description, confidence, evidence, implications, recommendations).
  - `analysis_report`: Stores a dictionary summarizing analysis results.
  - `visualizations_generated`: Stores a list of file paths for generated visualizations.
- **Purpose**:
  - Extends the `AgentState` model to support the outputs of the insights agent, enabling seamless state transfer across the pipeline (ingestion → cleaning → analysis).
  - Ensures all analysis-related metadata is tracked and accessible for downstream processes or reporting.

## 3. `core/tools.py`

**Changes:**

- **New Analysis Tools**:
  - **perform_eda_summary**:
    - Generates a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) summary, including descriptive statistics, missing values, data types, dataset shape, and unique values per column.
    - Input is a JSON-serialized DataFrame; output is a dictionary with structured summary data.
  - **analyze_correlations**:
    - Computes correlation matrices for numeric columns using a specified method (default: Pearson).
    - Identifies strong correlations (absolute value > 0.5) and returns both the full matrix and significant pairs.
  - **identify_trends**:
    - Analyzes temporal trends for a specified date and value column.
    - Computes trend slope, overall trend direction (increasing/decreasing), and monthly seasonality (if applicable).
  - **detect_imbalances**:
    - Identifies distribution imbalances in categorical data (e.g., categories with <5% representation).
    - Calculates the Gini coefficient to quantify inequality in category distribution.
  - **run_statistical_tests**:
    - Performs hypothesis testing (t-test, ANOVA, chi-square) between groups based on a group column and value column.
    - Returns test statistics and p-values, with error handling for invalid test types or group counts.
  - **create_visualization**:
    - Generates visualizations (scatter, bar, line, histogram, boxplot) using Matplotlib/Seaborn.
    - Saves plots to specified output paths and ensures directory creation.
    - Returns the file path or an error message if the visualization type is invalid.
  - **generate_insights_summary**:
    - Synthesizes analysis results into policy-relevant insights.
    - Currently focuses on strong correlations, generating insights with titles, descriptions, confidence levels, implications, and recommendations.
- **Dependencies Added**:
  - Imported `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `seaborn`, and `scipy.stats` for statistical and visualization tasks.
- **Purpose**:
  - Provides a robust set of tools for statistical analysis, trend identification, imbalance detection, and visualization.
  - Enables the insights agent to perform complex data analysis tasks and produce visual outputs for stakeholder communication.

## 4. `orchestrator.py`

**Changes:**

- **Pipeline Extension**:
  - Added the insights agent to the pipeline, running it after successful ingestion and cleaning.
  - Checks for errors or incomplete cleaning before proceeding to insights generation.
- **Result Display**:
  - Prints detailed insights results, including:
    - Key insights with titles, descriptions, confidence levels, implications, and recommendations.
    - Analysis report summary.
    - List of generated visualization file paths.
  - Lists additional output files: `statistical_analysis.json`, `policy_insights_report.md`, and `visualizations/*`.
- **Logging and Output**:
  - Updated the final output message to reference the state’s `output_dir` for consistency.
  - Enhanced logging to include insights-specific logs.
- **Purpose**:
  - Integrates the insights agent into the full data analytics pipeline, creating a cohesive workflow from ingestion to actionable insights.
  - Improves user feedback by displaying detailed analysis results and generated files.
  - Ensures robust error handling to prevent running the insights agent on invalid or incomplete data.
